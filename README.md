The focus of this project is to provide a password account management system for a user accessed via a browser. Produce a hand coded application whereby an individual can manage their own passwords and accounts for different applications. As a minimum your application should provide the following functionality: • Use local storage to store personal account data such as username and password. • Read a JSON file using the format above to identify a matching username in your system. • Indicate password strength to the end user. You will need to determine what additional features this application should have and the best way to visualise this information for the 
user. 


In today's digital age, we have numerous online accounts, each requiring unique usernames and passwords. This can lead to password fatigue, causing individuals to use weak or repeated passwords, which compromises their online security. To address this issue, this project aims to develop a password account management system, providing users with a secure and convenient way to manage their online credentials.
The proposed system will enable users to store their account data, including usernames and passwords, locally, and match usernames using a JSON file. Additionally, the system will assess password strength, offering users guidance on creating strong passwords. By providing these features, the system will help users maintain online security and reduce the risk of identity theft and unauthorized access.
Developing this password account management system is an essential thing because it addresses a crucial aspect of online security. By offering users a secure and user-friendly platform to manage their passwords, it can promote online safety and reduce the likelihood of cyber attacks. Furthermore, this project allows us to enhance the overall user experience and encourages individuals to adopt better password selection practices.



In this project I am aiming to create a simple, secure, and user-friendly password management system accessible via a web browser. The website will hopefully allow individuals to store, manage, and assess their passwords for different accounts efficiently.
